# Crime & Gangs

{% hint style="info" %}
Although FiveM is based on the framework of GTA V, this does not mean everything is about being a gangster and running around shooting each other.

Not every "gang" needs to be hostile and cause problems. try to be original and creative with your roleplay
{% endhint %}

* Any criminal activity (Breaking the law, not just robberies) is limited to 5 criminals.&#x20;
  * This includes having outside help of any sort, this includes lookouts, radio communications, or backup
  * You are not allowed to bring a active scenario to an area where you know you will violate this rule. (this means gang turf, known NPC hostile areas, areas of active conflict)
  * You are not allowed to violate this rule by having multiple groups
* Fake hostages are NOT allowed. you must plan accordingly.
* Robbing (stores, banks, trucks, atms, etc) requires planning. Do not just initiate a robbery without an in-depth plan. (Don't just rob a bank and flee. be creative)
* Initiation is required before shooting. You must roleplay and users your words. A message from twitter does NOT count as initiation. confrontations must in some way be initiated in person (or agreed upon before hand with the parties involved)
* You are not allowed to "tax" or "farm" known spots for any reason. this is powergaming and is not allowed
* You are allowed to rob other players by roleplaying. (do not abuse the raise hand mechanic)
  * You are NOT allowed to rob someone just for the sole purpose of stealing there belongings
  * Do not abuse robbing players. Only take what is needed and do not 'wipe' pockets just because you can
* Currently there are not limits on what can be robbed, but if we see abuse this rule will change
* Major Robberies (Stores, Banks, Trucks are not allowed within 45 minutes before or after a restart
* Non-Major Crime (ATMs, Selling drugs, house robberies, robbing players, etc.) are not allowed within 30 minutes before or after a restart
* If an unscheduled restart or server crash occurs, wait 15 minutes before committing any crimes
