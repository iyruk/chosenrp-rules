# Communication

{% hint style="info" %}
Players should report any user violating our rules using discord. (please make sure to include all information and evidence to support the report)
{% endhint %}

* English is our communities language. You must be able to speak and communicate in that language in order to join and roleplay in pubic areas (privately communicating with someone in another language is ok)
* We do not allow racism, sexual harassment or discrimination of any kind. Violation of this in or out of character will result in a ban
* Please ensure your hardware is setup properly for communication. (you may be talked to by staff to address poor audio concerns)
* OOC communication while in the server is not allowed.
* Please avoid breaking the immersion of roleplay. Do your best to roleplay a scenario even if there are technical issues. If you need to, report an issue or bug after the scenario and the staff will work with you in compensation or resolution of the issue
* Advertisements of other FiveM communities or servers is not allowed in our discord and our servers. Multiple offenses may result in a ban
* Threats of any kind aimed at hurting any person within our community (or the community itself) will not be tolerated and will result in a permanent ban
* While in character, offensive language is permitted but provides a reason to the offended character to take hostile action against you. (Harassment is not allowed in our community at all)
