# Quality of Roleplay

## Definitions

**Fail Roleplay (FailRP):** Actions that are unrealistic or hurt the roleplay experience of other players are considered as fail roleplay, however, not all actions that may seem unrealistic are punishable.

**Low Quality Roleplay (LQRP):** Providing minimal and/or low effort into setting up scenarios or doing little to work when involved in an existing RP scenario

**Value of Life (VoL):** At all times you respect the life of your character, and react in the same fashion you would in real life with any situation presented to your character.

## Quality Examples

**This is not a "money tycoon" game**\
Don't play in our server with the intent to grind. Money should come second to the roleplay.

**Responding to being held hostage**\
****Failing to value your life would be If you respond from being held at gunpoint like you are just upset with the inconvenience vs you being scared and worried you might die or be hurt. This is not realistic and you need to show proper emotions related to the scenario

**Cop baiting is poor method to roleplay**\
****When you are intentionally trying to get the cops attention without reasonable RP is not acceptable. (eg; intentionally speeding to have them chase you, or flaunting illegal weapons to try to start a shootout)

**Being outnumbered**\
****Refusing to comply to demands while you are outnumbered because "you are a gangster" is not acceptable. This also means you wouldn't attempt to try and escape because you are surrounded

**Refusing EMS interactions**\
****Everyone should be interacting with roleplay, even if it's a bare minimum. Failure to communicate after EMS attempts to assist you may result in you being kicked

**Abusing Scenes**\
Scenes are used to enhance existing roleplay. putting "pile of shit" near a toilet for giggles is NOT acceptable

**Acting on injuries**\
****If you were just shot a few times and decide to talk normal instead of acting out on the injuries, that is considered low quality and provides little to no effort in your roleplay

**Ignoring reasonable actions (`/me` or verbal request)**\
When you are given an action from `/me` in a scenario (eg; `/me removes mask` and you fail to react to this request, this is considered failrp
